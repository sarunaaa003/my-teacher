Hey ! Welcome to the **Thoughts of Vrindha**. 

My name is Vrindha. I've created this site to appreciate and celebrate my Elementary school teachers becuase they worked at my school Greathouse Shyrock elementary school for years. They are special this 2020, they are teaching online classes, creating documents online, meeting us online to keep us motivated and help us with our class work which are really hard and not normal for them.

I sincerely want to appreciate following teachers who are my most helpful.

**[Mrs.Mattingly](/blog/mrs.mattingly/)** is my Homeroom teacher

**[Mrs.Davis](/blog/mrs.-davis/)** is my Principal
