I personally learned a lot when I was creating this website about simple key tricks, hugo dev, vs code and AWS Amplify. {dev is a coding helper website to create websites.}

I also like to thank Internet Archives and all the Youtube channels from where I was able to use their materials in my blog.

Also thank my dad for helping me through this process
