## Dear Mrs.Davis,

I miss you during this quarantine, one example that I miss you is you walking in the class and greeting us in the morning with a big smile and wishing us good morning.

Nowadays, I like the way you help me by sending emails to my parents, there are lot of information on them and helped me to prepare for my online classes.

I thought I need to share this along with some of your favorite things as a virtual gift.

**These flowers are for you since you like Rose's.**
