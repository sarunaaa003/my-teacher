## Dear Mrs.Anderson ,
I miss you and what I miss about you is how you take time off from your work to give us counselling lessons to share my emotions and my feelings in private. You always encourage me and others. Also you always be at the car line in the end of the day and say goodbye and you make everyone smile before they go home. 


I thought I need to share this along with some of your favorite things as a virtual gift.

**These flowers are for you since you like Rose's.**

I hope you are taking care of yourself and I wish  you go to your favorite lakes once this quarantine is over until then enjoy this lake.
