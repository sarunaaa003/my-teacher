## Dear Ms.Bokting,
I miss you this quarantine , and why I miss you is because how you tell us where the books are  and  tell us to follow the rules in the library. Also I miss the way the books are organized and I like being organized. I'm  also trying to keep my book safe and tidy.

I thought I need to share this along with some of your favorite things as a virtual gift.

**These flowers are for you since you like Daisy's.**

Also here is a book you might like reading : [pdf](/doc/the-great-gatsby.pdf)

I hope you are treating yourself with your favorite chocolates and books. I learned that books can take you into another world of imagination. I believe that you will like this video.
