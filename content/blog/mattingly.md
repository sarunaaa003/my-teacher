## Dear Mrs.Mattingly,

I miss you during this quarantine, one example that I miss you is you explain really complicated things in easy ways so we can understand .Also I miss you greet us in the morning with a big smile on your face and sometimes with a bear hug.

Nowadays, I like the way you help us during online meetings and create fun ways to like virtually play and get along and go over our classwork.

I thought I need to share this along with some of your favorite things as a virtual gift.

**These flowers are for you since you like Lily's.**

I hope you are taking care of yourself with your favorite naps and I believe that your dog is keeping you busy like the dogs in the video.
